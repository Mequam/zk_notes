# Functions Of Several Variables

these are any function that takes several variables as input

f : R^n->R

## notation

f(x,y,z...) = n

> for example f(x,y,z) = x + y + z

--- 

## Domain

the domain of a multivariable function
is a structure in some higher dimensional space

> e.g. a cube a square a plane some strange triangle in 3d space

### Example

1. 
    1/(x^2-y^2)

    this has domain xS2-yS2!=0
    this implies that xS2 != yS2
    thich in tern says abs(x) = abs(y)
    
    > remember this is the domain they are NOT equal on

2.
    h(x,y) = sqrt(1-x*x-y*y)/ln(y-x)

    note that 1-xS-yS >= 0 must be satisified
    so 1 = xS+yS must be satisfied
    
    **=> our domain is a circle**

    for ln(y-x) != 0 && y-x > 0
    
    following the top we have
    
    - y-x != 1
    - y != 1+x

    following the right side we have
    y > x

   > Note that the range of the top of our equation INCLUDES the boundry
   > but the range of the bottom of our equation does NOT
