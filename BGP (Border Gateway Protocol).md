## About
This is an inter domain rounting protocol

BGP routers exist at the **edge** of a given network, and connect outwords to the outside world

> typically BGP routers also talk OSPF to the routers in the local network

there are two components of a BGB router

1. eBGP - interacts with subnet information from neighboring ASes
2. iBGP - propigates reacibility infor to all internal AS routers

> basically, this is anoying network speak for internal and external BGP
