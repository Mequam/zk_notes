## Definition

A function (+) is commutative if and only if the order in which we apply variables in the function **does not matter**.

that is to say a + b = b + a.

## Abstract Proof
given a set of properties of (+) and (\*) we can prove that \* is Comunative

note that exponentiation fails the second condition, if we swap n and a, exponentiation fails the third conditio
