There can be alergies with guinea pigs,
you need to make sure that you are **not** alergic to them before you get them.

make sure that you have an exautic vet near you when you get them. Pigs can get a lot of problems that need to be taken care of, they die REAAAAALY fast if these are not taken care of.

### Needs

10.5 square feet minimum for the pigs.

Pigs need an open cage. They poo and pee a lot, and if it is enclosed the amonia will bill up and kill the pig.

CMC cage, which is a grid and core plast cage.

Buy grid cage units, they can be found online, zip tie them together to make the cage large. CNC cage is the word for this.
