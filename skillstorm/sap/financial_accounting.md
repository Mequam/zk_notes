## About


> tl;dr Basically this covers the accounting side
> of things of the buisness

financial accounting is the way that a business determines 
its health.

this is actually a legal requirement. Someone has to be tracking
how good the company is doing.

Recall that company codes are uniquely associated with financial legals


these follow standards like the GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles)


the idea is to answer some basic questiosn

1. what does the business owe
2. what does it own (assets)
3. has it earned profit or loss
4. can it meet its short term obligations

### Primary Objectives

1. keep records of financial transactions
2. report data to stakeholders
3. help stakeholders make rational decisions

these are more or less what you would expect them to be :)
