## Functions

### Overhead Cost Controlling (CO-OM)

analyze costs not directly associated with specific products or accounts
basically a high level overview of the company

### Cost Element Accounting (CEA)

granular management of costs

> uses cost elements as an individual granular unit


### Profitability Analysis (CO-PA)

this is about identifying what areas of the business are profitable
and where

think this specific business line in this specific region.
the idea here is to let the company make informed decisions to put more marketing
or costs in an area that needs it


### Product Cost Controlling (CO-PC)

determines the cost of makin' stuff

the idea is that accuratly determining the cost of goods will allow us to
make more informed decisions about how much we need to spend on a raw material or
good

### Cost Centers Verses Profit Centers

these are elements used in the above functions


cost centers are areas that take up costs (e.g. you spend on them)
where as profit centers are where you get money from

departments will always have a cost center and a profit center associated with them,

### Operating Concenrs

central organizational unit in profitability analysis

## Controlling Area

a collection of different companies and groups that represent a financial snapshot


these are the primary organizatiol unit in CO accounting, as we want to be able to get 
financial info from MANY different companies.

> one controlling area can have multiple company codes

a good example of these would be Amazon picking up twitch. They still want to be able
to let twitch run as an indipendint company, but they also want to know if twitch is
profitable. So they could add twitch to a controlling area for Amazon to get a sumamry
of it's profits in their controlling area while letting the compay still run.
