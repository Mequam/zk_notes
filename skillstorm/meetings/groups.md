# skillstorm/meetings/groups

## About

groups are a (depricated) way to lump together tiles
they are deprictated and getting moved out for spaces and pages

groups consist of one or more tiles related to the specific area

business catalogs they reference must be assigned to the same role

## Deprication

groups are getting replaced by pages as a better newer way to organize
