# abap/cds/action

## About

actions are used to create custom operations on an object inside of a cds view
you need to create the action in the behavior definition, then in the abap object class
to run your custom code, and finally as metadata to get it to display on the screen

there are exmples bellow for this

## Examples

### Meta Data

```cds
@UI.lineItem: [{ type: #FOR_ACTION, dataAction: 'addWarning', label: 'Add Warning' }]
```
place this above a line item to get the button to appear there

### Behavior

```behavior
action ( features : instance ) addWarning parameter ZA_HAZMAT_Warning result [0..1] entity ZR_HAZMAT_Warning_Link;
```

### ABAP

the adt should auto generate this for you, look at the behaivor definition and hover your mouse
over it to get the suggestion

in addition to filling out the function definitions for the action, you also need to enable
the permisions for the action by setting the result in those functions, example code to do
this is listed bellow

> these method signuatures should be auto generated by adt, you need to fill out the
> "guts" however

```

  METHOD get_global_features.
    "result-%action-SyncData = if_abap_behv=>fc-o-disabled.
    result-%action-SyncData = if_abap_behv=>fc-o-enabled.
