without order of operations, this is ambiguos. There is no way to know what order to perform operations in.

**we** know how to use order of operations to add parenthasis, but computers have trouble with this idea.

Lots of exptra computation is needed in order to treat order of operations.

**enter polish notation**

## Definition

Polish notation is a notation where we do not need to use implicit or explicity parenthasis, this nullifies the need for the computer to parse parenthasis.

2. prefix
3. postfix
