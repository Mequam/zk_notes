___

## Proof

Concider taking the difference of two functions multiplied together.

since multiplication is often used in the computation of areas, it is very natural to view this as a modification in the area of a square whose side lengths are f and g respectivly.


When we change f and g, the side f will change by some amount, and the side g will change by some amount. We can see that change in this graph, where the colored rectangles represent new (or lost) area.

We can solve for the area of these rectangles, wich represent the change in f*g, and in doing so the equation given in our definition pops right out.
