## Multi Variable Integration

consider a function with a 2d domain
![alt](./assets/images/function_with_domain.svg)

we can [[calc3.multiVariable.visualization]] to see this as a 3d shape

![alt](./assets/images/3d_domain_shape.svg)

a natural question to ask is what is the area of this shape

![alt](./assets/images/double_integral.svg)

we can think about shredding the region into a bunch of little squares and adding together all of the "little collumns" of the function to compute the double integrals.

we can look at this still another way

## Partial integrals

note that this function will give you the area of a **slice** of the 3d solid that we are [[visualizing|calc3.multiVariable.visualization]]

a vertical slice if you will

![alt](./assets/images/green_area.svg) of the whole 3d region.

now imagin adding together all the infinit slices of the region

We can expand this to get

we call this form an iterated integral 

> sman calls it a scanning electron beam

note that we could replace x and y and get a valid equation.
