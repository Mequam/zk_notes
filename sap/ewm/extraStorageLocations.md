# sap/ewm/extraStorageLocations

## About

the udemy quiz im using to practice has these two extra storage
locations that I can't find anywhere else, so for now they get listed here

per the quiz

> There are many advantages to using ROD and AFS in SAP EWM.

> First of all, it allows for better inventory visibility. By knowing
> exactly where items are, companies can better plan shipments and orders.

> In addition, the use of ROD and AFS allows for better
> inventory traceability, which is important for companies working in regulated industries.

> Finally, it allows for better coordination between the different departments of
> the company, such as sales, shipping and production.


## AFS (Available For Sales)


this is the final storage locations before items
are sold out to the customer

## ROD (recieve on doc)

used when items are recived, but not yet at their final destinations
