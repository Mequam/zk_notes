# sap/ewm/exceptionCodes

## About

these are triggered when the system detects an error in the ongoing processings of the warehouse.

Naturally things get mixed up in complex environment, so error codes are used to indicate that there
is a correction somewhere that needs to occure.


exception codes are allways assigned to a business context and an excecution step

basically these indicate where the exception can be used and where the exception is coming from
