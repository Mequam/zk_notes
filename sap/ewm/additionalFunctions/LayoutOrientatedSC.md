this is used when products do not travel directly from source
to storage, but have to move around the warehouse

1. Unloading at door
2. Counting at the counting station
3. Identification of goods at the ID point
4. Putaway in the high-rack storage area

notice the focus on position, a process based look would follow more of bellow
