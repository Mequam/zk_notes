## About

The system that our decentralized EWM can connect too
depends on the version of EWM

```
SAP Business Suite based decentral EWM

connects with

R/3 4.6C and up 
(
includes R/3 Enterprise and all 
subsiquent SAP ERP releases
)
and any SAP s/4 HANA system
```

```
SAP S/4 HANA 1909

connects with

SAP ERP 6.0 EhP 3 or higher
or
SAP S/4HANA OP1611 or higher
```


```
"Since SAP S/4HANA 1610 EWM is technically included as embedded EWM,
this means that no separate installation is necessary. That approach has
certain advantages, but also restrictions that must be considered."

-SAP
```


depending on the release of the ERP system or enhancement packages
stored certain features may or may not be available on the EWM system

> you can get more inforamtion on this in SAP release notes
> installation guides and notes
