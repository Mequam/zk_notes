## About

in two step picking the process is split into two steps


1. withdrawl (removal from the warehouse)
2. allocation (assign withdrawn products to appropriate delivery)


note that when you withdrawl you are often taking more than one product out so you get 10000 m&m's out of 
the system, and then assign those m&m's to different packages.

note that you create two warehouse tasks for this in the system.
