## About

according to SAP products can be put away directly, or with the help of storage control
in the SAP system.

In addition to the basic process of receiving a product quantity into the warehouse and putting it away in a storage bin, many warehouses have additional processing requirements including the following:

- Unloading
- Counting
- Quality inspection
- Deconsolidation (unpacking into individual HUs)
- Kitting
- Value added services


There are two forms of storage control:

- Process-oriented
- Layout-oriented
