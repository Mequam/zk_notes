## About

the knapsack problem is a problem that is about picking up items that are in front of you.

imagine a travaling hobbo picking up items.

There are two variations of it, 0-1 knapsack where you cannot break apart the items that you take in, and fractional knapsack where you can fractionalize the items you pick up!

## Remarks

![alt](./assets/images/knapsack_example_problem.svg)

how many of each item should you get in the knapsack?

binary knapsack will **not** give you an optimal solution when run as a greedy algorithm, but fractional knapsack will!
