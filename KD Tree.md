## About

a k-d tree can be thought of as a multi dimensional key tree.

A traditional binary tree stores only one entry in each node.

A k-d tree can have any number of items stored in each node.

## Key Ideas

there is no one definition for how to sort the keys in a k-d tree. Typically an algorithm is devised to fit the problem that you are working with.

In either case, all other binary tree algorithms aply, the only difference is that you need a function to tell you how to sort the higher dimesnional tags.

the following is a recomended method, but there are others that you could use.

> The key idea here is very simple. We alternate which element of our higher dimensional key that we look at depending on the height of our tree.

> All other binary tree algorithms apply. With this rule taken into account.
