## Forward
The following is a collection of notes on a subject best described as integer calculus.

The primary focus of the subject is the integer change of functions, and as such the tools recorded here are a collection of techniques which we have developed for summing together and differencing different functions.

They are accurate as far as we can tell, but since we are only human, the reader is encouraged to veryify the proofs and ideas following :).

These notes are provided in the hope that they will be helpful, or at the very least interesting.

Good Reading,
