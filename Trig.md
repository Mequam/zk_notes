## About

it has been proven that the difference
of sin and cos is a function of some real number
and that this number can be changed to set the difference and anti difference of the function. 

The proof for this remains to be written down and edited, but a graph of the function exists for analysis

[desmos link](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/awivrkvjk0)

the capitol N is the slider for difference and anti difference.

Something about the angle addition formula was used when we derived this, I sadly forget the details however :(
