## Definiton

given two operations (+) and (\*)

$$distributes\ over\ + <=> c*(a+b)=c*a+c*b$$

## Abstract Proof

this is elementary for multiplication and addition, but what follows is a way to show that repeated applications of repeated [[IntegerCalc.Abstract.Comunative]] functions will maintain this property.

![alt](../assets/images/abstract_distrobution_proof.svg)

this means any operation (\*) which is repeated applications of a communicative operation (+) are distribute over their repititon.


this proves that exponentiation is distrubuted over multiplication.
