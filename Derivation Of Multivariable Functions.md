## Reference
[[calc3.multiVariable]]

1. ## The Begining
    when differentiating multi variable funcitons, we first select a variable to differentiate with respect to.

    We then treat all other variables as constants and continue differentiating like normal

    > Just like with single variable functions, we need the function to be continous to differentiate
