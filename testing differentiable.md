## Forward

just because we can take the partial derivatives of a function f **does NOT** mean that the function is differentaitable

Concider 

![alt](./assets/images/not_differentiatable.svg)

all of the direction derivatives of this funciton exist, and yet we cannot satisfy the property where we build the other derivatives from the partial derivatives


> thus we cannot find the directional derivative using partial derivatives
