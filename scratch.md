## Possible Project Ideas:

- list of high volatility goods
    - how do we read goods from the system
    - do we have any stock in the sytem
        probably not
    - can we see a history of inbound and outbound deliveries in SAP
        not without goods in the system

- list of high performance employees
    - we don't have workers in the system

- table of cleanup section to distribute work where necessary

- employee food tracker
