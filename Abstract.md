## About

currently, it looks to be the case
that many theroms from integer calc
can be generalized to work with
abstract functions as apposed to 
simply multiplication and addition

it is the aim of these notes to work out just how to do that and find if that is the case

these are more scratch notes than solved products, so treat them as such
