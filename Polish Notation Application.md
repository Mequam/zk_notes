## About

we can use polish notation and a stack in order to rapidly evaluate expressions.

## algorithm

1. first we push the whole expression onto the stack

2. then we pop items until we hit an operator
3. perform the operation of the operator
4. push the result back on the stack

> Repeat this until there is one result
