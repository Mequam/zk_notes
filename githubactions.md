# githubactions

## About

github actions is a feature of the github website that you can use in order to create ci/cd pipelines
it is especially useful since you can trigger actions when code is pushed or merged from a given
branch


## Actions

you can pre package actions to be used by others on github, these are very useful as they save quite a bit of time
in setting up the pipeline
