## Cage 

Hamsters can travel up to 5 miles every single night.

As such they need a LARGE hamster cage.

800 square inces of floor space or larger.


Prolly gonna make a custom cage.

Make sure that you place the cage out of direct sunlight or drafts.


### Bedding 

Hamsters spend a LOT of time digging in their burrows. They typically have multiple layers in their cage that they burrow in.

Recommended to use **up to** 6 inces

#### Unsafe Bedding

1. pine shavings
1. ceter shavings
1. any sented bedings

#### Safe bedding

1. paper
1. hemp
1. aspin
1. birch
1. spruice


Some beddings are better than other beddings for bedding.

If you want to improve the bedding quality for burrowing you could layer in hay to let it burrow in.

**AVOID COTTON** it can wrap around the hamster and KILL THEM.

They REAAAALY like toilet paper.

### Wheel

they have the urge to travel, so the HAVE to have a wheel.

they need a SOLID wheel so they do not injure themselfs on the wheel.

#### Safe wheel

1. Silent Runners
1. Silent Spinners
1. Rotor wheels
1. night angel reals

The hamsters back should be completely straight when running. The bigger the wheel the better.

Avoid the saucer wheel.


### Hamster ball

dont do it, its dangerous.

- They can't control the ball which can harm them.
- The ball has bad ventilation.
- Hamsters also tiny.
- They could also catch their foot in the ball.
- Ball is not a good source of enrichment

### Enrichment 

need to offer toys and things to play with for hamsters.

### Diet 

Hamsters are omnivores, they eat leafs seeds small animals.

Comercial food is often rly boring, so we need to feed more food to the hamsters.

> Pellets are an option, because they will be VERY picky if they do not eat pellets otherwise
> The laddy here says not to use pellets, but that sus. idk tho hamsters != budgies

Fruits and vegetables can be fed to hamsters.

#### Tiny Food 

Hamsters hoard food, so the food can go bad if you give it to them too large. If you cut the food into little tiny bits it will dry out and last longer!

tldr tiny food is good.


### Cleaning

Hamsters need to have their cage cleaned, but not EVERY week, that will stress them out.

A comlete cage clean SCARES them.
