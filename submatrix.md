## About

sub matricies are a very simple way
to break apart a matrix into smaller sub matricies

there might be a better name for these, but I call them sub matricies :)

Each sub matrix works by deleteing a row and column and "squishing together" the remaining numbers into a smaller matrix. 

We can notate this using the intersection of the columns that get deleted.

This is written bellow in the following example:

note that this obviously works for any dimensionality of matrix.
