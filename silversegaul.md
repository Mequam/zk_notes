# silversegaul

## About

silver segaul was a haskell ray tracing engine that used a pure approach to the program.

> It was bad

render servers should not use a pure approach as you want to save on computation time by
storing the image in memory. Also recurison with image generation is for people who like cocain
like they like their RAM, don't do it :).
