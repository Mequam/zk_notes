## About

spring is a framework that uses dependency injection to provide java
programs with a suite of pre built behaviors, specificaly web behaviors
is what it is OFTEN used for (as far as my current research shows)

spring BOOT is a project that configures spring with several standard
configurations to save time when setting up a new project

## Project Setup


### CLI

the following cli command can be used to start a spring project

```bash
spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa my-spring-boot-app
```

see [installing spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/installing.html#getting-started.installing.cli)
for how to install the cli, (check the AUR if on arch :))

### Website

additionally spring uses a website to start its projects (in fact
it appears that the cli tool actually goes through the site)

to use this method select the options that make sense for your project
