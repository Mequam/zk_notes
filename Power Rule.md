## Definition

## Proof

this follows straight from the [[IntegerCalc.BiNomialTherom]] and  the definition of [[IntegerCalc.Difference]]

## Common Examples

In general to compute the difference of $$x^{n}$$ we can use the numbers from pascells triangle as coefficients in the differecne sum.

here is a list of differences overlayed in pascells triangle.

it should be noted here that the first term in each sum will allways be the derivative of the power, as n-1 take n will allways be n with n-1 in the power
